    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Depression is a mood disorder that affects more than 264 million people globally, making it one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. It's characterized by symptoms such as profound sadness, the feeling of emptiness, anxiety, sleep disturbance, as well as a general loss of initiative and interest in activities. The severity of a depression is determined by the quantity of symptoms, their seriousness and duration, as well as the consequences on social and occupational function.</p>
    <p>One way to classify depression is unipolar and bipolar; unipolar depression refers to major depressive disorder and bipolar depression is a facet of bipolar disorder. They are both genetic mood disorders and share symptoms, but a distincion should be made between the two: bipolar depression is unique in the periodic occurrence of mania, a state associated with inï¬‚ated self-esteem, impulsivity, increased activity, goal-directed actions, and reduced sleep.</p>
    <p>Although there are known, effective treatments for mental disorders, between 76% and 85% of people in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment for their disorder. One barrier to effective care is inaccurate assessment: in countries of all income levels, people who are depressed are often not correctly diagnosed.</p>
    <h5>How does sensor data come into play?</h5>    
    <p>Actigraphs are small motion sensor detectors (accelerometers) that are encased in a unit about the size of a wristwatch, and can be worn continuously for days to months. It is well established that depression is characterized by altered motor activity, and actigraph recordings of motor activity are considered an objective method for observing depression. Despite not being exhaustively studied yet, there is an increasing awareness in the field of psychiatry on how the activity data relates to various mental health issues such as changes in mood, personality, inability to cope with daily problems, or stress and withdrawal from friends and activities.</p>
    <p>In the following tutorial, we will walk through the Data Science Pipeline to see if depression states can be accurately predicted through the sensor data recorded by Actigraphs.</p>
